Grasp is a local MCP server that gives AI agents full browser control through Chrome DevTools Protocol. It creates a dedicated `chrome-grasp` profile where your agent logs in to services once and retains every session permanently — completely separate from your personal browsing.

**Current release:** `v0.1.0`

---

## What Grasp stands for

Grasp is an open-source, fully local MCP server. No cloud. No subscription. No data leaving your machine.

The design is built around one idea: **the agent should have its own browser, not borrow yours.**

`chrome-grasp` is a dedicated Chrome profile that belongs to the agent. It is isolated from your personal browsing. The agent logs in to the services it needs once, and every session persists permanently. Your tabs, history, and extensions are never involved.

**What makes Grasp different:**

**Open source and local-first.** The entire codebase is MIT-licensed and runs on your machine. There is no cloud backend, no telemetry, no account required. What the agent does stays between you, the agent, and the browser.

**A browser that belongs to the agent.** Other tools borrow your real browser or spin up a blank one. Grasp gives the agent a profile it owns. Sessions accumulate over time — the longer the agent uses it, the more it has access to.

**Hint Map.** Instead of dumping raw HTML into the context window, Grasp scans the live viewport and produces a compact semantic map:

```
[B1] Submit order      (button, pos:450,320)
[I1] Coupon code       (input,  pos:450,280)
[L2] Back to cart      (link,   pos:200,400)
```

IDs are fingerprint-stable across calls. Token cost drops 90%+ versus raw HTML.

**Real CDP events.** Every click is a mouse curve. Every scroll is a sequence of wheel events. Every keystroke has per-character delay. Not `element.click()` — real input dispatched through the DevTools Protocol.

On pages that expose `window.__webmcp__`, Grasp calls native tool APIs directly and skips DOM parsing entirely. On every other page, Hint Map and real events take over. The agent never needs to know which mode it is in.

## Why Grasp exists

Giving AI browser access today comes with three bad options:

| Option | Problem |
|:---|:---|
| Cloud headless browsers (Browserbase, Steel) | Data leaves your machine, no cookies, unreachable on private networks |
| Local Playwright with a new profile | Fresh profile every time, all logins gone, SSO and 2FA fail |
| Page-reading tools | Read-only, cannot interact |

Grasp is the fourth option: a persistent, local, agent-owned browser that starts every task already logged in.

## What ships in this repo

Grasp `v0.1.0` includes:
- an MCP server in `src/server/` with 18 registered tools
- a Chrome bridge and adaptive execution engine in `src/layer1-bridge/`
- a Hint Map perception layer in `src/layer2-perception/`
- a real-event action layer in `src/layer3-action/`
- a CLI in `src/cli/` with `connect`, `status`, and `logs` commands
- an audit log written to `~/.grasp/audit.log`
- a safe mode that intercepts high-risk actions before they fire
- one-click AI client auto-configuration for Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor
- a `grasp connect` wizard that bootstraps everything from scratch

## How it works

```
Your chrome-grasp profile (logged in, sessions intact)
         |
         | Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)
         |
    Grasp MCP Server
         |
         | MCP stdio
         |
    Your AI Agent (Claude / Codex / Cursor)
```

**Adaptive execution engine** — on every navigation, Grasp probes for WebMCP support in under 50ms. Pages that expose `window.__webmcp__` get native structured tools with zero DOM parsing. All other pages fall back to Hint Map + real event execution.

**Hint Map** — instead of sending raw HTML, Grasp scans the viewport and returns a compact semantic map:

```
[B1] Submit order      (button, pos:450,320)
[I1] Coupon code       (input,  pos:450,280)
[L2] Back to cart      (link,   pos:200,400)
```

Token consumption drops 90%+ compared to raw HTML. IDs are fingerprint-stable across calls.

**Real events, not JS injection** — every click is a mouse curve (15 steps, random landing offset). Every scroll is 5 CDP wheel events with 20–60ms random gaps. Every keystroke has 30–80ms per-character delay.

## Install

### One-click (recommended)

```bash
npx grasp
```

This runs the `grasp connect` wizard: detects Chrome, launches it with a dedicated `chrome-grasp` profile, and auto-configures your AI client.

> First launch: the wizard opens `chrome-grasp`. Log in to any services your agent will use. Sessions are saved permanently in that profile.

### Add to AI client manually

#### Claude Code CLI

```bash
claude mcp add grasp -- npx -y grasp
```

#### Claude Desktop / Cursor

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grasp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "grasp"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Codex CLI

Edit `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.grasp]
type    = "stdio"
command = "npx"
args    = ["-y", "grasp"]
```

### Global install

```bash
npm install -g grasp
grasp connect
```
